        <p>Instead of doing the same thing every single day, it is beneficial to try new things. When people experience new things, and are introduced to new material, they are learning. Some people do not realize it, but we all learn something new every day. Learning is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience..</p>
        <p> Learning can be adaptive and flexible to meet life’s demand. Although it is important to learn new things, the new material learned is not as important as the process of learning itself. In the process of learning, one’s mind is transformed and engaged. They will be introduced to new things and their ideas and thinking will be changed forever. </p>
